Ex:
A()
{
	this();
	//There wont be any IIB calling statement kept by the compiler, bcz already from the current class constructor IIBs got executed, once again it wont execute here.
}

- Java doesnt supports multiple inheritence in case of classes.
- One class cant extends more than one class at a time.
Ex: Invalid
class A
{
}
class B
{
}
class C extends A, B
{
}
